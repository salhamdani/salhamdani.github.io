I will present this at the UW Madison Donut seminar in Spring 2023 and upload the presentation here afterwards. Stay tuned!

As a preview, here is the statement of the theorem:

<div class="theorem" text="The Infinite Monkey Theorem">
A monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.
</div>
