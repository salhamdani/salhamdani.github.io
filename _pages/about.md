I am a mathematics Ph.D. student at University of Wisconsin-Madison, with intent to declare my doctoral minor in statistics. My primary interests of the mathematical variety include, though are not limited to, harmonic analysis, analytic number theory, probability theory, and applied mathematics/statistics. Nowadays, I am more of a casual reader of medical physics - my interests are in imaging and diagnostic modalities.

Before starting the doctoral program, I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Biomedical Physics along with a Master’s in Mathematics at California State University, Fresno (go Bulldogs!). My Master’s thesis studied the zero distribution of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind with binomial-type coefficients. Afterwards, I briefly worked in institutional research and data science. Further details can be found on my [CV](/cv).

The best way to reach me is by email: alhamdani at math dot wisc dot edu. I usually try to respond within 24 ± 12 hours on business days.
