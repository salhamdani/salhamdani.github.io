#### UW-Madison

##### Mentorship & Leadership
I am extremely passionate about improving accessibility to advanced mathematics for minoritized groups. I was previously an [LSAMP student at Fresno State](https://csm.fresnostate.edu/lsamp/index.html), and participated in the [PUMP summer program](https://www.pump-math.org/summer-program/summer-2016-program). I'm more than happy to talk about my experiences or share my advice.

I currently volunteer for the mathematics department's Undergraduate Mentorship Program (UMP), where I co-mentor a group of students who are interested in pursuing math-related careers in industry or graduate studies in mathematics.
